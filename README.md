A personal weight tracking app.

Created after I canceled my $20 a month myfitnesspal subscription and could not extract the historical data going back to 2011 without a premium subscription.

Unfortunately I had to pay for premium to get the data, which really made me upset.

Only really cared about my weight and mesasurements anyways so this should do.

This app is hosted on my internal network and I access to via wireguard.
